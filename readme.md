# Hospitality Room Allocation System

This project implements a simple room allocation system for a hostel, taking into account group gender and room capacity.

## Project Structure

- **index.html:**  The main HTML file containing the user interface for uploading CSV files and viewing the allocation results.
- **app.py:** The Flask application that handles file uploads, room allocation logic, and result display.
- **hostel_info.csv:**  A CSV file containing information about available rooms in the hostel.
- **group_info.csv:** A CSV file containing information about the groups to be allocated.
- **allocations/allocation.csv:** A CSV file generated by the application, containing the room allocation results.

## Files and their Contents

### 1. index.html

This file contains the HTML structure for the user interface. It provides:

- A form for uploading two CSV files:
    - `group_info.csv`: Information about the groups to be allocated.
    - `hostel_info.csv`: Information about the available rooms.
- A button to trigger the upload and allocation process.
- A link to download the generated `allocation.csv` file.

### 2. app.py

This file implements the Flask application, which performs the following tasks:

- **File Uploads:** Handles the upload of `group_info.csv` and `hostel_info.csv`.
- **Room Allocation:** Implements the core logic for allocating groups to rooms based on gender and capacity.
- **Result Generation:** Creates `allocation.csv` containing the allocation results.
- **Result Display:** Shows the allocation results in an HTML table.
- **Download:** Allows users to download `allocation.csv`.

### 3. hostel_info.csv

This file stores information about available rooms in the hostel. It has the following columns:

- **Hostel Name:** The name of the hostel.
- **Room Number:** A unique identifier for each room.
- **Capacity:** The number of people a room can accommodate.
- **Gender:**  The gender assigned to the room (e.g., 'Boy', 'Girl', or 'Mixed').
